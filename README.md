# PrettyRAST

A module to aid in reviewing code generated by RakuAST.  To use:

```
    use Pretty::AST;
    pretty-print RakuAST::StrLiteral.new('a'); # "a"
    colorize-RAST; # activate colored output
```

Color is hard coded at the moment (using xterm-256) to match Comma's default fairly closely.  
Down the road, customizable options via some form of a config file will be available.
If you intend to use `Pretty::RAST` inside of Comma IDE (or other IntelliJ-based environment),
be aware that colorized output should be avoided, as colorized text is gobbled up in the IDE's
terminal.

If you are using this and you run into a node that is not yet support, `Pretty::RAST` will 
display as its name in blue flanked by Camilas (e.g. `ðŸ¦‹NodeðŸ¦‹`).  If this happens, feel free to 
submit a PR adding support for it.  (In the meantime, I'll add them as I end up using them in 
my own code).  

### Known issues

   * Code is ugly as sin.  This is an initial QAD attempt.
   * Only a small portion of nodes are currently supported
   * Uses overly simple hueristics for whitespacing.
   
### Todo
   * Support more nodes
   * Customizable colors
   * Rewrite indent code to be smarter and more maintainable (and maybe customizable?)
   * Additional output options (html + css?)
